SLIDE 3: A BIT ABOUT ME
-----------------------

A Bit About Me

Hi, I'm Ian McDonald

On January 1st, 2024, after losing my dad, I made a bet on myself. I decided 
to teach myself how to build apps with AI—no computer science degree, no bootcamp, 
just curiosity and refusing to quit when it got hard.

18 months later, I've built:

→ An AI platform serving nearly 2,000 active users

→ Enterprise tools used by real businesses

→ A growing waitlist for Launchbox—my platform that helps creators like me 
  offer courses, education, tools, and community all in one place

Layout:

SLIDE 6: WHY THIS WORKSHOP? - PART 1 (KEEP AS IS)
--------------------------------------------------

Most people think building is for "tech people"


SLIDE 7: WHY THIS WORKSHOP? - PART 2 (KEEP AS IS)
--------------------------------------------------

AI changed that

BEFORE: Complex code
[Code example showing intimidating syntax:]
function createWebsite() {
  const server = require("express")();
  const db = new Database({
    host: "localhost",
    port: 5432,
    user: "admin",
  });
  server.get("/", (req, res) => {
    res.render("index", {
      data: fetchData()
    });
  });
}

Intimidating, right?

AFTER: Simple conversation
[Chat interface example:]
"Build me a professional website with my bio, contact info, and a modern design"

✓ I'll create that for you right away...

→ Website built in minutes

That's it. Really.


SLIDE 8: THE CONCEPT (NEW - REPLACES OLD AI BASICS)
----------------------------------------------------

[Top text - Large, centered]
This website...

[Center - Website screenshot placeholder]
[Impressive-looking professional website with modern design, multiple sections]

[Bottom text - appears after pause]
...was built with this:

[Prompt text box]
"Build a professional website for a marketing consultant. Include bio section, 
services overview, testimonials, and contact form. Modern design with blue and 
white color scheme."

[Final line - Large text]
That's AI development.
Plain English → Working Website


SLIDE 9: WHY THIS WORKSHOP? - PART 3 (KEEP AS IS)
--------------------------------------------------

Today:

60 minutes

The barrier isn't technical anymore.

"Okay, so what's next? Few things:

First, Launchbox. That's the platform I'm building where creators can offer 
courses, community, and AI tools all in one place. If that sounds interesting, 
join the waitlist. Founders get special pricing when it launches.

Second, I'm doing more workshops like this. If you want to know when the next 
one is, join my newsletter. I also share AI tips and tools I'm using as I build.

Third, join the Facebook group - Idea to AI. That's where we hang out between 
workshops. Share what you're building, ask questions, help each other out.

Now, here's the thing. Today we built something simple. But what if you want 
to build something MORE?

I'm running a 4-week bootcamp starting [DATE]. Small group - max 10 people. 
We meet live every week for 90 minutes, and we build REAL apps together. 
Not toys. Real tools you can use in your business.

Week 1: Landing page with lead capture
Week 2: Custom tool or calculator
Week 3: Dashboard with data
Week 4: Whatever YOU want to build

Normally $497. For you, because you showed up today, it's $297. But that 
expires Friday.

If you're thinking 'I want to keep going, I want to build more, I want Ian's 
help'—grab one of those 10 spots.

Or, if you have a specific app idea and want 1-on-1 help, I do consulting. 
90 minutes, $197, we build your thing together.

Links are on the screen. And there's a feedback form—please fill it out. 
Tell me what you loved, what you didn't, what you want to learn next. 
That helps me make these better.

Any questions?"

Conversion Strategy:
--------------------
- Launchbox waitlist = primary CTA (future revenue, audience building)
- Newsletter/Community = free engagement (retention)
- Bootcamp = immediate revenue ($297 × 10 = $2,970 for 6 hours work)
- Consulting = high-touch upsell ($197/session)
- 48-hour urgency on bootcamp (converts while energy is high)
- Expected conversion: 10-15% bootcamp, 30-40% waitlist, 50-60% newsletter
