SLIDE 2: INTRODUCTION (Who's Teaching This?)

Top Section (Text + Photo side-by-side):

Left Side:
Who's Teaching This?

Hi, I'm Ian McDonald

I went from healthcare worker to self-taught app developer in 18 months.

I've built:
• An AI platform with 1,500+ active users
• Enterprise tools without a computer science degree
• This workshop to prove you don't need to be "technical"

I'm not here to sell you a course. I'm here to show you what's possible when you just start building.

Let's do this together.

SLIDE 3: WHY THIS WORKSHOP?
----------------------------

Why This Workshop?

I learned by doing. No bootcamps. No CS degree. Just AI tools, curiosity, 
and refusing to quit when it got tough.

If I can do it, you can too.

Today, you'll see exactly how AI makes app development accessible to anyone 
willing to learn and experiment.


SLIDE 4: AI BASICS
------------------

Understanding AI Development

The "Magic": AI & App Dev Basics

The "Old Way" (Traditional Development)
Normally, to build a website, you'd have to write hundreds of lines of code in languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You'd also need to learn frameworks, databases, and how to set up a server. It's powerful, but has a very steep learning curve.

The "New Way" (AI-Powered Development)
Today, we're using a new approach. We will use AI to be our developer. We'll describe what we want in plain English (our "prompt"), and an AI platform like Firebase Studio will write all that complex code for us.

What We Are (and Aren't) Building
Our site today is a simple "static" site—it just displays information. More complex apps might need a database (to store user signups) or authentication (to let users log in). We aren't doing that today, but it's good to know those are the "next steps" in app development.


SLIDE 5: YOUR INFORMATION
