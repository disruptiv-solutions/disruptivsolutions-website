SLIDE 3: A BIT ABOUT ME
-----------------------

A Bit About Me

Hi, I'm Ian McDonald

On January 1st, 2024, after losing my dad, I made a bet on myself. I decided 
to teach myself how to build apps with AI—no computer science degree, no bootcamp, 
just curiosity and refusing to quit when it got hard.

18 months later, I've built:

→ An AI platform serving nearly 2,000 active users

→ Enterprise tools used by real businesses

→ A growing waitlist for Launchbox—my platform that helps creators like me 
  offer courses, education, tools, and community all in one place

Layout:
- Two-column layout (text on left, image on right)

SLIDE 6: WHY THIS WORKSHOP? - PART 1 (KEEP AS IS)
--------------------------------------------------

Most people think building is for "tech people"


SLIDE 7: WHY THIS WORKSHOP? - PART 2 (KEEP AS IS)
--------------------------------------------------

AI changed that

BEFORE: Complex code
[Code example showing intimidating syntax:]
function createWebsite() {
  const server = require("express")();
  const db = new Database({
    host: "localhost",
    port: 5432,
    user: "admin",
  });
  server.get("/", (req, res) => {
    res.render("index", {
      data: fetchData()
    });
  });
}

Intimidating, right?

AFTER: Simple conversation
[Chat interface example:]
"Build me a professional website with my bio, contact info, and a modern design"

✓ I'll create that for you right away...

→ Website built in minutes

That's it. Really.


SLIDE 8: THE CONCEPT (NEW - REPLACES OLD AI BASICS)
----------------------------------------------------

[Top text - Large, centered]
This website...

[Center - Website screenshot placeholder]
[Impressive-looking professional website with modern design, multiple sections]

[Bottom text - appears after pause]
...was built with this:

[Prompt text box]
"Build a professional website for a marketing consultant. Include bio section, 
services overview, testimonials, and contact form. Modern design with blue and 
white color scheme."

[Final line - Large text]
That's AI development.
Plain English → Working Website


SLIDE 9: WHY THIS WORKSHOP? - PART 3 (KEEP AS IS)
--------------------------------------------------

Today:

60 minutes
1 live website
Built by YOU

The barrier isn't technical anymore.
It's belief.

Let's prove it.


SLIDE 10: WHAT YOU'LL DO TODAY (NEW - REPLACES OLD AI BASICS)
--------------------------------------------------------------

[Four steps in columns with icons and time estimates]

[Bottom banner]
Total time: ~30 minutes
Result: Live website YOU built with AI


SLIDE 11: WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN WE BUILD IN LOVABLE
-------------------------------------------------

Title:
------
What to Expect While We Build in Lovable

Section 1 — The Tool (Lovable.dev):
-----------------------------------
- We'll be building inside Lovable.dev. It's free and includes enough AI build credits for today's workshop.
- If you've used it before and already hit a limit, follow along, take notes, and you can redo the steps later on your own account.
- This slide reinforces the prep email so no one is surprised.

Section 2 — Things Will Be a Little Messy (and That's Okay):
------------------------------------------------------------
- AI might pick a weird layout, use the wrong image, mess up copy, or even time out.
- That's normal. Debugging small issues is part of what you're learning.
- Goal: ship a live, imperfect version 1—not a polished portfolio site.

Section 3 — How We'll Use Our Time:
-----------------------------------
- 5 minutes – Paste your prompt & run the first build
- 10–15 minutes – Adjust layout, fix obvious issues, add your details
- 5 minutes – Deploy and grab your live link
- If tokens, accounts, or Wi-Fi cause issues, you'll still get the replay, slides, and your prompt.

Section 4 — How I'll Handle Questions While We Build:
-----------------------------------------------------
- Channel: drop questions in chat while we build.
- Checkpoints: after we generate the prompt, after the first Lovable build, after we deploy.
- If you're really stuck, I'll note your name and hang back after the main 60 minutes for one-on-one help.

Section 5 — Different Speeds Are Normal:
----------------------------------------
- If you finish early: tweak copy, try different colors, or add one extra section (testimonials, FAQs, etc.).
- If you're behind: focus on getting a working v1. Design polish happens later.
- This keeps fast folks from getting bored and slower folks from feeling rushed.
